# CompBio-Dual-RNAseq-Malaria
Computational analysis of host parasite interactions in malaria from existing data


Malaria is one of the most researched disease caused by a eukaryotic organism. RNA-sequencing has become the go-to method to study gene expression and is heavily implemented in malaria studies to understand disease mechanisms during an infection. While publishing scientific work that involves sequencing of samples, scientists are required to submit the sample sequences onto NCBI in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) or on one of the mirror databases - ENA and DDBJ. For understanding any disease, and in our case, malaria, these databases are an excellent resource for a vast amount of sequence information and metadata.

We used sequence database, SRA, to obtain relevant malaria RNA-seq studies to perform a meta-analysis and infer host-parasite interactions.
